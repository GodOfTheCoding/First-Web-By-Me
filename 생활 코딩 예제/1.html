            I know I'm a genious devleoper. 
            <br>That's because I've been coding since I was young.
            <br>At that time, I made several small small games thruogh "Scrach" and "Entry."
            <br>And now I'm studying html, css, and Javascript. After entering a great club, I study hacking contents.
            <br>In this respect, I can fully infer that I will became a global developer in the future.
